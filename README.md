### Serious Game ? 
Serious game is a field where game are developed in goal to learn something. In our case, we choose the healthcare field. 

### Objective
This game is intended to be used in __therapeutic education activities__ that take place in the hospital. These 15 minute sessions are designed to teach patients how to deal with their diabetes on a daily basis. 
The target audience are __children between 6 and 10 years old__ with type 1 diabetes. We propose to use our game during a session so that they learn to live with the disease. 


### Scenario 
The player makes choices and __helps a character with type 1 diabetes__. The player moves sideways and collects objects that will be used to heal the patient at the end of the game. In each game, a problem / learning is targeted.
It is an alternation of __course and mini game__ (question/answer). All the answers are collected and recorded in a database that can be retrieved by health professionals organizing the course. They will be able to have a feedback and review the concepts not understood.
